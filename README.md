# Project Overview
    This is a Currency Converter app built using Flutter, designed to fetch, cache, and display 
    currency exchange rates.The app uses a clean architecture design and integrates local caching 
    to enhance performance and usability.Below, you will find instructions on building the project 
    and explanations of the design patterns, libraries, and databases used.

## How to Build the Project

## Steps to Build
    Clone the repository:
    git clone <repository-url>
    Navigate to the project directory:
    cd currency_converter
    Get all dependencies:
        flutter pub get
    Run the project:
        flutter run
    Ensure you have an emulator running or a physical device connected.
    To build an APK:
        flutter build apk --release
    The APK will be available in the /build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/ directory.

# Adapted Design Pattern for the App Architecture

## Clean Architecture
    The app is built using the Clean Architecture pattern, which ensures separation of concerns by 
    dividing the app into the following layers:

## Data Layer:
    Handles data sources (e.g., remote APIs, local databases).
## Domain Layer:
    Contains business logic and interacts with repositories.
## Presentation Layer:
    Includes UI components (widgets) and state management.

## Benefits of using clean architecture
    Testability: Each layer is independent, making the app easier to test.
    Scalability: Well-organized architecture ensures the app can grow without becoming complex.
    Separation of Concerns: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data handling.
    Reusability: Business logic and data sources can be reused across different parts of the app or 
    in other apps.

## Additional Architectural Patterns
## Dependency Injection (DI)

    The app employs Dependency Injection to manage the creation and sharing of dependencies. 
    By using a service locator (e.g., GetIt), dependencies like DatabaseManager, 
    CurrencyLocalDataSource, and CurrencyRemoteDataSource are injected where needed.

## Advantages of DI:
    Improved Testability: Dependencies can easily be mocked during testing.
    Centralized Configuration: Dependency management is centralized, simplifying maintenance.

## Singleton Design Pattern
    Some components, such as DatabaseManager, follow the Singleton Design Pattern to 
    ensure only a single instance exists throughout the app lifecycle.

## Advantages of singleton:
    Resource Efficiency: Prevents multiple instances of the database connection from being created.
    Global Access: Ensures a shared state across the app without redundant instantiations.

# Centralized API Client and Error Handling
    The app includes a centralized API client to manage all network interactions and error handling, 
    ensuring consistent and robust communication with remote servers.

## Centralized API Client:
    The API client encapsulates common configurations such as base URLs, headers, timeouts, 
    and serialization.
    Example: A single HTTP client handles all requests, ensuring uniform behavior and reducing 
    duplication.
# Centralized Error Handling:
    Errors from remote APIs or local operations are handled centrally to standardize error 
    responses and user feedback.
    Example: The Failure class captures errors with a title and message, making it easier to 
    display user-friendly error messages in the UI.

# Benefits of Centralization 
    Consistency: Centralized handling ensures that all API calls and errors are managed in the same 
    way,reducing potential bugs and discrepancies.
    Reusability: Common configurations and error-handling logic are reused across the app, 
    reducing boilerplate code.
    Improved Debugging: By centralizing error reporting, it becomes easier to identify and 
    address issues in the app.
    Scalability: As the app grows, centralized management simplifies the addition of 
    new endpoints or error cases.

# cached_network_image

    This app uses the cached_network_image library to load and display currency flags. 
    This library caches images locally to avoid repeated downloads.

## Benefits of using cached_network_image
    Efficient Caching: Automatically stores downloaded images locally to save bandwidth and 
    improve loading times.
    Placeholder Support: Displays placeholders while images are being downloaded.
    Performance: Reduces the load on remote servers and enhances the app's performance 
    for end-users.
    Fallback Mechanism: Provides fallback images in case of a network error, 
    improving the user experience.

# sqflite

    The app uses SQLite as the local database, managed with the sqflite plugin, 
    for caching exchange rates. 
    Timestamps are stored to check the cache validity.

## Benefits of using sqflite
    Lightweight and Fast: SQLite is a lightweight embedded database that works well 
    on mobile devices.
    Structured Data: Ideal for storing structured data (e.g., currency codes, rates, and timestamps).
    Local Persistence: Enables offline access by caching data locally.
    Reliability: Proven stability and support in Flutter projects.


# Future Improvements
## Reusable Widgets
    To create modular and reusable UI components to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
    Examples of Planned Widgets:
    Custom Button: A reusable button widget with consistent styling across the app.
    Currency Tile: A widget to display currency flags, codes, and exchange rates in a unified format.
    Error Display: A widget to show user-friendly error messages consistently throughout the app.
    Common Styles and Themes
    To centralize the appâ€™s visual design using a common theme and style system for better 
    consistency and maintainability.
